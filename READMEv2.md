### Indexed tests created with Supertest, Mocha, Chai and Typescript with in-built BDD assertions. 

- Background: These tests were created in line with the previous Postman collection I delivered, containing identical indexing with some minor additions. I followed the previous end2end style of arranging the tests spreading flows across multiple test files, using Chai 'expect' for assertions, these tests could be modified to utilise an afterEach cleanup hook with end2end tests contained inside a single test class. Also I mostly focussed on positive tests, negative testing would be very straightforward to implement using this approach. Supertest is a Super-agent driven library for testing node.js HTTP servers using a fluent API.

1. Install steps:
	1. Install node.js
	2. create new folder for tests to reside
	3. ensure you copy following files from github repo: 'tsconfig.json' + /tests folder into root of newly created folder
	4. From command line ensure you run 'npm init -y' inside newly created folder
	5. From command line run 'npm install supertest mocha chai --save-dev' inside newly created folder
	6. From command line run 'npm i --save-dev @types/mocha' inside newly created folder
	7. From command line run 'npm i --save-dev @types/node' inside newly created folder
	
2. Test details: 
	- Tests contain 58 indexed test files
	- 1 helper class
	- 2 .txt files (for writing tokens to, deprecated)
	
3. Switching from dev to prod env:
	- In helper class comment/uncomment baseUrl and clientId to desired corresponding environment inside method.exports. 
	```
	dev environment on/prod off:
	module.exports = {
		   baseUrl: {
			//dev
			"url": "https://kq5xvr42bi.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test-qa-judeshiels-dev",
			//prod
			//"url": "https://dudq8wv4c5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test-qa-judeshiels-prod",
		    },
		    clientId: {
			//dev
			"id": "q69csigu8dnp4106sdokq0l6n",
			//prod
			//"id": "4p57q2erkqvv515r41hls93lor",
		    }
	    }
	    
	  prod on/dev off  
	  module.exports = {
		     baseUrl: {
			//dev
			//"url": "https://kq5xvr42bi.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test-qa-judeshiels-dev",
			//prod
			"url": "https://dudq8wv4c5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test-qa-judeshiels-prod",
		    },
		    clientId: {
			//dev
			//"id": "q69csigu8dnp4106sdokq0l6n",
			//prod
			"id": "4p57q2erkqvv515r41hls93lor",
		    }
	    }
4. To run test scripts:
	- cd to tests folder
	- From command line or IDE terminal run npx mocha *.ts
		
5. Expected results on dev:
	- 104 passing
  	- 4 failing
	- expected failing tests: 15.1, 14.4, 14.3, 14.2 
	
6. Expected results on prod:
	- 92 passing
  	- 16 failing
	- expected failing tests as above plus photoUrl issue which does not occur same as on dev, impacted: 10.1 x 3, 9.3, 9.2, 9.1 , 7.1 x 3, 6.3, 6.2, 6.1.
	
7. Meeting acceptance criteria

##### The acceptance criteria that the API must meet are the following:

	• A user can:
	
	◦ List all customers in the database. ↓
	 REF: 7. Query/CustomerReadModels/onCreate

	◦ Get full customer information, including a photo URL. ↓
	 REF: 6. Queries/CustomerReadModel/onCreate & 7. Query/CustomerReadModels/onCreate 

	◦ Create a new customer:  ↓
	 REF: 5. Mutations/SaveCustomer/Create

	▪ A customer should have (an asterisk indicates that it is a required field): ↓

	 REF: 6. Queries/CustomerReadModel/onCreate & 7. Query/CustomerReadModels/onCreate 
	▪ * name,
	▪ * surname,
	▪ * id (autogenerated),
	▪ photoUrl ↓
	 REF: 18.4 & 18.5 & 18.6
	▪ * userId
  
	▪ Image uploads should be able to be managed. ↓
	 REF: 5. Mutations/SaveCustomer/Create

	▪ The customer should have a reference to the user who created it.  ↓
	 REF: 5. Mutations/SaveCustomer/Create & 18. Add customer with newly created Admin end2end workflow

	◦ Update an existing customer. ↓
	 REF: 9. Queries/CustomerReadModel/onUpdate & 10. Query/CustomerReadModels/onUpdate

	▪ The customer should hold a reference to the last user who modified it.  ↓
	 REF: 9. Queries/CustomerReadModel/onUpdate & 10. Query/CustomerReadModels/onUpdate 
	 & 18.5 query/CustomerReadModel get customerId:4 data

	◦ Delete an existing customer. ↓
	 REF: 11. Mutations/DeleteCustomer/Delete

	• An admin can also:   
	
	◦ Manage users:
	▪ Create users. ↓
	 REF: 2. Mutations/Create/SaveUser
	▪ Delete users.  ↓
	 REF: 16. Mutations/UserReadModel/Delete
	▪ Update users. ↓
	 REF: 14. ChangeUserRole/Tests & see Issues Noted below
	▪ List users.   ↓
	 REF: 3. Queries/UserReadModel/onCreate & 4. Query/UserReadModels/onCreate
	▪ Change admin status.   ↓
	 REF: 14. ChangeUserRole/Tests
